# Markdown

**What is Markdown**

   Markdown is an easy-to-use syntax for formatting in GITHub. It allows the use of special characters (syntax) to apply formatting such as **bolding**, indentations, *italics* ~~and more~~ etc.

**Command line 101**

   Opened up the console terminal and tested each of the given commands; this is what each line stands for.

*ls*
* Looks into the directory.

*cd /tmp*
* Takes us to the directory "/tmp".

*cd $HOME*
* Takes us back to the home directory. 
* The $ symbol brings you back to the start of the directory line.

*mkdir [Directory Name]*
* Creates a new directory.

*echo "Hello" > hello.md*
* **echo "Hello"** prints the message within parenthasis to the terminal.
* **> hello.md** creates a Markdown file which calls the function echo "Hello" when input.

*cat hello.md*
* *cat {File}* calls up whatever is inside the file, and prints it to the terminal. 

*cp hello.md hello-again.md*
* *cp {Source} {Destination}* copies the source file to a destination file.

*mv hello-again.md hello-hello.md*
* *mv {Source} {Destination}* renames or moves the source file to a destination. If we use *cat hello-hello.md*, it calls up the "Hello" message from earlier. (Showing we have copied hello.md to hello-again.md, then renamed hello-again.md to hello-hello.md.)

*rm hello.md*
* *rm {File}* removes the file.

*rm -rf*
* *rm -r* deletes the directory and all its contents. **Typically, rm without the -r does not delete directories.** The f after -r voids the statement.

*cat /proc/cpuinfo*
* As mentioned above, this calls up a file, in this case "/cpuinfo", located inside the directory "/proc".
